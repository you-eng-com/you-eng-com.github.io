1
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:03,295
You don't understand.

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:06,548
For us, kissing is as
important as any part.

3
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:08,217
Yeah, right!

4
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,054
You serious?

5
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:14,056
Oh, yeah.

6
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:17,768
- Everything is in that first kiss.
- Absolutely.

7
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,521
For us, kissing's an opening act..

8
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,857
like the comedian
you have to sit through..

9
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,068
before Pink Floyd comes out.

10
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:32,574
And it's not that
we don't like the comedian.

11
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:37,955
It's just that that's not
why we bought the ticket.

12
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:44,002
The problem is, no matter
how great the show was..

13
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,756
you girls are looking
for the comedian again.

14
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:52,886
We're in the car, fighting traffic,
just trying to stay awake.

15
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,808
Word of advice:
Bring back the comedian.

16
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:02,729
Or next time you'll find yourself
listening to that album alone.

17
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,862
Are we still talking about sex?

18
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:13,282
The One With the Sonogram at the End

19
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,373
No, it's good. It is good.

20
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,169
It's just that Doesn't she seem
a little angry?

21
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,712
Well, she has issues.

22
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:11,673
Does she?

23
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,384
Try to live with "Mr. I'm Evolving."

24
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:21,683
He's out while she's home getting
the mastodon smell out of the carpet.

25
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,229
Marsha, see, these are cave people.

26
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,440
Okay, they have issues like:

27
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:32,277
"Gee, that glacier's
getting kind of close."

28
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,822
Speaking of issues,
isn't that your ex-wife?

29
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,866
- No.
- Yes, it is. Carol, hi!

30
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:42,204
Okay. Yes, it is.
I'll catch up with you in the Ice Age.

31
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,164
- Can I stay?
- No.

32
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,514
- Hi.
- Hi.

33
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:11,066
- Is this a bad time?
- No, it's..

34
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:13,485
the Stone Age.

35
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:19,491
You look great. I hate that.

36
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,787
Sorry. Thanks. You look good too.

37
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:26,623
Well, you know,
in here, anyone who..

38
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,751
stands erect..

39
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,966
- What's new? Still a
- A lesbian?

40
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:41,597
You never know. How's the family?

41
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:47,060
- Marty's still totally paranoid.
- Carol, why are you here?

42
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:51,607
- I'm pregnant.
- Pregnant.

43
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,701
She didn't leave
in such a hurry after all.

44
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,623
This is the Three's Company episode
with a misunderstanding.

45
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,337
Then I've already seen this one.

46
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,131
Are you through with that?

47
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,092
Sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.

48
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,262
Whose ball of paper is this?

49
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:26,391
Mine. I wrote a note to myself,
then I didn't need it.

50
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,645
So I balled it up
and now I wish I was dead.

51
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:36,193
She already fluffed that pillow.
You already fluffed It's fine.

52
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,322
I just don't wanna give them
any more ammunition.

53
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:44,660
Parents can be cruel about
the flatness of a child's pillow.

54
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,748
Relax, you do this every time.
The place looks great.

55
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:53,460
You got a lasagna here
that looks good enough..

56
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,337
to avoid touching.

57
00:04:58,674 --> 00:04:59,925
Monica? Hi!

58
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:04,346
Monica, you're scaring me.

59
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:09,059
I mean, you're all chaotic
and twirly, you know?

60
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:10,686
Not in a good way.

61
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:18,402
Calm down. You don't see Ross
getting twirly every time they come.

62
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,364
That's because my parents think
Ross can do no wrong.

63
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,408
You see, he's "The Prince."

64
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:28,161
They had some big ceremony
before I was born.

65
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,459
- What?
- Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

66
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,926
- Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
- It's beautiful.

67
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:51,059
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

68
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,061
No, don't touch that.

69
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,860
Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow
enough, having to give it back.

70
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:05,240
"Hi, Barry, remember me? I'm the girl
that stomped on your heart."

71
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,660
Now I must return the ring
without the ring..

72
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,788
which makes it so much harder.

73
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,708
Easy, we'll find it. Won't we?

74
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,795
Look, it's gonna be okay.
You'll give it back..

75
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:23,091
- and we'll eat ice cream.
- Okay. It's a pear-shaped diamond

76
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,428
Any diamond ring we find,
we'll run it by you.

77
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:32,643
- When did you have it last?
- Doy, right before she lost it.

78
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,731
You don't get
a lot of "doy" these days.

79
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,944
I know I had it this morning.

80
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,280
I know I had it when I was
in the kitchen with

81
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,907
Dinah?

82
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,288
- Oh, don't be mad.
- You didn't.

83
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:57,793
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I gave you one job!

84
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,797
But look how straight
those noodles are.

85
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:07,177
That's not how you look
for an engagement ring in a lasagna.

86
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,056
I just can't do it.

87
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,978
Boys? We're going in.

88
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,445
Hi.

89
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:30,742
- That is not a happy "hi."
- Carol's pregnant.

90
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,411
I found it!

91
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:37,833
What?

92
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,459
Yeah.

93
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:45,132
Do that for two hours, you might
be where I am about now.

94
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:49,303
That puts that whole
pillow thing in perspective.

95
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,099
How do you fit into this whole thing?

96
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:57,019
Carol and Susan want me
to be involved.

97
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:01,899
But if I'm not comfortable with it,
I don't have to be involved.

98
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:06,486
- It's totally up to me.
- She is so great. I miss her.

99
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:15,913
- What does she mean by "involved"?
- Your job is done.

100
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,791
And the most enjoyable.

101
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,629
Phoebe, say something.

102
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,216
They want me to go down
to this sonogram thing..

103
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,051
with them tomorrow.

104
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,386
Remember when life was simpler..

105
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,014
and she was just a lesbian?

106
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,601
Those were the days.

107
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:41,688
- What are you gonna do?
- I have no idea.

108
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:45,651
No matter what I do,
I'm still gonna be a father.

109
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,829
This is still ruined, right?

110
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:07,130
Martha Lugwin's daughter
is gonna call you.

111
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:13,595
- What's that curry taste?
- Curry.

112
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,936
I think they're great. I really do.

113
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,273
The big Lugwin had a thing for you.

114
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,985
- They all had a thing for him.
- Oh, Mom.

115
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:30,487
Why is this girl going to call me?

116
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:36,577
She just graduated, and she wants
to be something in cooking or food..

117
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,204
I told her you have a restaurant

118
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:44,042
- I don't have, I work in a restaurant.
- They don't have to know that.

119
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:51,633
- Ross, help me with the spaghetti.
- Yes.

120
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:55,512
Oh, we're having spaghetti.
That's easy.

121
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,640
We were going to have lasagna.

122
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:01,768
- I love lasagna.
- We're not having it.

123
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,856
Then why bring it up? He latches on.

124
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,819
This will sound unbelievably selfish..

125
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:14,781
but did you plan to bring
up the baby/lesbian thing?

126
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,492
It might take the heat off of me.

127
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:24,333
That Rachel.
We saw her parents at the club.

128
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,627
They were not playing well.

129
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,004
I won't say what they spent..

130
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,798
but $40,000 is a lot for a wedding.

131
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:38,639
At least she had the chance
to leave a man at the altar.

132
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,561
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

133
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:47,898
- It's an expression.
- No, it's not.

134
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:51,401
Don't listen to her.
You've always been independent.

135
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:54,029
Even when you were a chubby kid..

136
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:57,366
and you had no friends,
you were just fine.

137
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:02,079
You'd read alone in your room.
Your puzzles..

138
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:09,586
People like Ross need
to shoot for the stars.

139
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:12,673
With his museum
and his published papers.

140
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:16,301
Others are satisfied with
staying where they are.

141
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,929
These people never get cancer.

142
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:23,141
They're happy with what
they have, content..

143
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,394
like cows.

144
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,647
Cows, Dad?

145
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,942
She knows how much I love cows.

146
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:38,574
I read about women trying
to have it all, and I thank God..

147
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:41,827
our "Harmonica"
doesn't have that problem.

148
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:48,000
- I'm telling you, you'll be fine.
- Thank you, Daddy.

149
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,212
Oh, so this does work.

150
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,843
So, Ross, what's going on with you?

151
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:03,807
Any stories? No news, no little
anecdotes to share with the folks?

152
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:10,689
Look, I realize you guys
have been wondering..

153
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,984
what exactly happened
between Carol and me.

154
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:16,945
And so, well, here's the deal.

155
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,449
Carol's a lesbian.

156
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,953
She lives with a woman named Susan.

157
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,541
She's pregnant with my child.

158
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,545
She and Susan are
going to raise the baby.

159
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,218
And you knew about this?

160
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,019
Folks are really that bad?

161
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,814
Well, you know, these people are pros.

162
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,485
They know what they do.

163
00:12:56,693 --> 00:13:00,739
They take their time.
They get the job done.

164
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:05,494
They say that you can't change
your parents.

165
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:08,872
Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.

166
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:11,667
Must pee.

167
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:15,295
It's worse when you're twins.

168
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:17,506
- You're a twin?
- We don't speak.

169
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,676
She's this high-powered,
driven, career-type.

170
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:23,720
- What does she do?
- She's a waitress.

171
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:27,641
- Identical?
- People say we look alike.

172
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,184
But I don't see it.

173
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:33,355
You guys, I kind of
gotta clean up now.

174
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,441
Chandler, as an only child,
you don't have this.

175
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,987
No, although I did have
an imaginary friend..

176
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,030
who my parents preferred.

177
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:46,410
Hit the lights, please.

178
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:55,377
How long was I in there?

179
00:13:56,461 --> 00:14:01,008
- I'm just cleaning up.
- Oh, you need any help?

180
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,344
Okay, sure. Thanks.

181
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,059
Anyway..

182
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:15,355
So you nervous
about Barry tomorrow?

183
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:17,232
A little.

184
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,402
A lot.

185
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,198
So, got any advice?

186
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:27,618
You know, as someone
who's recently been dumped.

187
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:32,331
You may wanna steer clear
of the word "dumped."

188
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:37,878
Chances are he's gonna be
this broken shell of a man.

189
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:43,425
You should try not to look
too terrific. I know it'll be hard.

190
00:14:45,636 --> 00:14:49,932
Or I'll go down there,
and I'll give Barry back his ring.

191
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:54,811
And you can go with Carol
and Susan to the ob-gyn.

192
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,233
You've got Carol tomorrow.

193
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:03,779
- When did it get so complicated?
- Got me.

194
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:07,115
- Remember being in high school?
- Yeah.

195
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:09,868
Didn't you think you'd meet someone..

196
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:12,496
fall in love, and that'd be it?

197
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:19,837
- Ross?
- Yes. Yes.

198
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:26,260
Man, I never thought I'd be here.

199
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,184
Me neither.

200
00:15:51,577 --> 00:15:53,912
Sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.

201
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:57,708
There was this big
dinosaur thing. Anyway..

202
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,376
Hi.

203
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:03,922
- You remember Susan.
- How could I forget?

204
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,885
Hello, Susan.
Good shake, good shake.

205
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,764
So, we're just waiting for?

206
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,309
- Dr. Oberman.
- And is he?

207
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,477
- She.
- Of course, "she."

208
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:23,192
Is she familiar with our
special situation?

209
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:27,529
- Yes, and she's very supportive.
- Okay, that's great.

210
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:30,282
No, I'm Oh.

211
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:33,035
Thanks.

212
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,932
That opens my cervix.

213
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,690
- Barry?
- Come on in.

214
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:06,568
- Are you sure?
- It's fine.

215
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:08,987
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

216
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,409
So, how are you doing?

217
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,578
I'm..

218
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:19,289
I'm okay.

219
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:23,252
- You look great.
- Yeah, well.

220
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:26,463
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenspan's gagging.

221
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:29,508
Be right there. Be back in a second.

222
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:36,473
I dumped him.

223
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:58,036
So, how's this all gonna work?

224
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:01,081
The baby grows
in a special place inside

225
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,332
Thank you.

226
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:06,712
I mean, how's this gonna work,
you know, with us?

227
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:10,007
When important decisions
have to be made?

228
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:13,677
- Give me a "for instance."
- Well, I don't know.

229
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:17,347
- How about with the baby's name?
- Marlon.

230
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:20,142
If it's a boy. Minnie, if it's a girl.

231
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:23,812
As in "Mouse"?

232
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:26,690
As in my grandmother.

233
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:30,694
Still, you say "Minnie,"
you hear "Mouse."

234
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,364
How about..?

235
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:36,366
How about Julia?

236
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:39,745
- Julia.
- We agreed on Minnie.

237
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,623
We agreed we'd spend
our lives together.

238
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:45,501
Things change.
Roll with the punches.

239
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,212
I believe Julia's on the table?

240
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:52,716
Sorry about that.

241
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:58,347
So, what have you been up to?

242
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,933
Oh, not much.

243
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,102
- I got a job.
- That's great.

244
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:06,980
Why are you so tan?

245
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:11,902
I went to Aruba.

246
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,863
Oh, no. You went
on our honeymoon alone?

247
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,198
No.

248
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,411
I went with..

249
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:24,623
- Now, this may hurt.
- Me?

250
00:19:24,832 --> 00:19:25,916
No.

251
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:30,003
I went with Mindy.

252
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:31,839
Mindy?

253
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,550
My maid of honor, Mindy?

254
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,719
Yeah, we're kind of a thing now.

255
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,976
You got plugs!

256
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:47,062
Careful. They haven't quite taken yet.

257
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,273
And you got lenses.

258
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:53,026
You hate sticking your finger
in your eye.

259
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:54,695
Not for her.

260
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:01,034
Listen, I really wanted to thank you.

261
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,203
Okay.

262
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:08,834
A month ago, I wanted to hurt you
more than I've ever wanted to.

263
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,044
And I'm an orthodontist.

264
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:16,466
You know, you were right.
I thought we were happy.

265
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:18,552
We weren't happy.

266
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:21,305
But with Mindy..

267
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,891
now I'm happy.

268
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:26,393
- Spit.
- What?

269
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:28,061
Me.

270
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:31,940
Anyway..

271
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:38,280
I guess this belongs to you.
Or maybe some day Mindy.

272
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:40,866
Like she'd settle for that.

273
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:47,289
Yeah, that's true.

274
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:51,168
But I think it's a nice ring..

275
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:55,255
and thank you for giving it to me.

276
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:58,425
Thank you for giving it back.

277
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:02,137
Hello!

278
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:09,269
- Please, what's wrong with Helen?
- Helen Geller?

279
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:14,107
- I don't think so.
- It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

280
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:17,528
- Thank you.
- No, I mean, it's not Geller.

281
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:19,905
It'll be Helen Willick?

282
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:25,577
No, actually, we talked about
Helen Willick Bunch.

283
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:29,623
Wait a minute.
Why is she in the title?

284
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:31,250
It's my baby too.

285
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:34,670
Really? I don't remember
you making any sperm.

286
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:40,008
And we all know what
a challenge that is.

287
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:44,596
- You two, stop it.
- She gets a credit. I'm in there too.

288
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:50,519
Helen Willick Bunch Geller?
I think that borders on child abuse.

289
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:54,606
Of course not.
I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.

290
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:59,236
See what he does? He knows no one's
gonna say all those names.

291
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:01,989
They'll call her Geller.
He gets his way.

292
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:04,366
My way? You think this is my way?

293
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:08,162
Of all the ways I ever imagined
this moment being..

294
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:12,040
this is not my You know what?
This is too hard.

295
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:14,960
Knock, knock. How are we? Any nausea?

296
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:17,087
- A little.
- Just a little.

297
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:23,677
I was wondering about the
mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing.

298
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:27,347
- Lie back.
- You know what? I'm gonna go.

299
00:22:27,598 --> 00:22:31,935
I don't think I can be involved
in this family thing.

300
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:45,491
- Oh, my God!
- Look at that.

301
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:47,201
I know.

302
00:22:57,628 --> 00:22:59,755
Well, isn't that amazing?

303
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,677
What are we supposed to be
seeing here?

304
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:11,433
I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the Enterprise.

305
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:17,648
If you tilt your head
and relax your eyes..

306
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:20,734
it kind of looks
like an old potato.

307
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,820
Then don't do that, all right?

308
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:28,742
Monica, what do you think?

309
00:23:31,537 --> 00:23:33,705
- Are you welling up?
- No.

310
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:37,209
- You are. You're welling up.
- I'm not.

311
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:39,962
- You're gonna be an aunt.
- Oh, shut up.

312
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:45,342
Hi, Mindy. Hi, it's Rachel.

313
00:23:45,551 --> 00:23:49,304
Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today.

314
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:54,184
Yeah, he told me. No, it's okay.
Really, it's okay.

315
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:57,938
I hope you two are very happy.
I really do.

316
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:01,942
And, Min, you know,
if everything works out..

317
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,946
and you guys get married
and have kids..

318
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:09,324
I hope they have his hairline
and your nose!

319
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:18,375
That was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now!
