- Wait a minute.

156
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,422
We're talking about someone
that I'm going outwith?

157
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,420
GROUP: Yes.
- And did you notice?

158
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,967
GROUP:
Yeah.

159
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,475
Know what was great?
The way his smile was kind of crooked.

160
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,676
Yes, yes. Like the man in the shoe.

161
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,678
What shoe?

162
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,440
From the nursery rhyme.

163
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,893
"There was a crooked man
who had a crooked smile...

164
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,729
...who lived in a shoe for a while..."

165
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,034
So I think Alan...

166
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,451
...will become the yardstick...

167
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,405
...against which all future boyfriends
will be measured.

168
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,785
What future boyfriends?

169
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,538
No, no. I think this could be,
you know, "it."

00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,834
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

171
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,505
I'd marry him just for his
David Hasselhoff impression alone.

172
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,333
You know I'm gonna be doing that
at parties, right?

173
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,632
- You know what I like most about him?
- What?

174
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,685
The way he makes me feel about myself.

175
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,060
ALL:
Yeah.

176
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:54,871
Hi.

Well...

- We won!
- We won! Thank you! Yeah.

180
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,630
Fantastic. I have one question:
How is that possible?

181
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,008
- Alan.
- He was unbelievable.

182
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,762
He was like that Bugs Bunny cartoon
where Bugs is playing all the positions.

183
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:18,436
But instead of Bugs, it was first base, Alan.
second base, Alan...

184
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:25,481
I mean, it was like he made us
into a team.

Yep. We sure showed
those Hasidicjewelers...

Do you ever think that Alan
is maybe sometimes-

189

- What?
- I don't know. A little too Alan?

190
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,916
Oh, no. That's not possible.
You can never be too Alan.

191
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,842
Yeah, it's his innate Alan-ness
that we adore.

- Did you pick out the vowels?

195
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:06,352
Yes, but I left in the Y's.
Because, you know, "Sometimes Y."

Hey, this is so unfair.

311
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:47,399
Oh, man, there's really
no easy way to say this. Uh...

312
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,819
I've decided to break up with Alan.

313
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,363
Is there somebody else?

314
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,750
No, no, no. It's just...

315
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,955
...you know, things change.
People change.

316
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,206
We didn't change.

317
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,715
So that's it? It's over?

318
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,714
Just like that?

319
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,550
You know, you let your guard down.

320
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,853
You know, you start to really care
about someone, and I just--

321
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,942
- Look, I could go on pretending--
- Okay.

322
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,396
No. No, that wouldn't be fair to me...

323
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,401
...it wouldn't be fair to Alan,
or to you.

324
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,691
Yeah, well, who wants fair?

325
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,779
I mean, I just want things back,
you know, the way they were.

326
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,910
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, she's sorry. I feel better.

327
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,083
I just can't believe this.

328
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:51,964
I mean, with the holidays coming up.
I wanted him to meet my family.

329
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:56,176
I'll meet someone else.
There'll be other Alans.

330
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,552
Yeah, right.

331
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,978
- Are you guys gonna be okay?
- Hey, hey. We'll be fine.

332
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,810
We're just gonna need a little time.

333
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,320
I understand.

334
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,864
Wow.

335
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:21,993
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah. I mean, I'm sorry too.

336
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,788
But I gotta tell you, I'm a little relieved.

337
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,869
- Relieved?
- Yeah, well...

338
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,421
...I mean, I had a great time with you.

339
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,832
I just can't stand your friends.

340
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:42,393
Remember when we went
to Central Park and rented boats?

341
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,180
That was fun.

342
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:50,272
Yeah. He could row like a Viking.

343
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,107
- Hi.
GROUP: Hi.

344
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,945
So how'd it go?

345
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,953
- You know.
- Did he mention us?

346
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,965
He says he's really gonna
miss you guys.

347
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,847
ROSS:
You had a rough day, huh?

348
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,847
- Oh, you have no idea.
ROSS: Come here.

349
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,769
- That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
GROUP: No, no, no.

350
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:31,226
I don't care. I don't care.

351
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,562
Game's over. I'm weak. I've gotta smoke.
I've gotta have the smoke.

352
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,364
If you never smoke again,
I'll give you $7000.

353
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,029
Yeah, all right.

354
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,825
